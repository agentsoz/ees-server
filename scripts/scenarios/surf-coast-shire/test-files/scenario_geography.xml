        !!! Update 27/Oct/16 DSINGH: Leaving the following information in for
            now, will need to be updated.


	The following data relates to defining regions etc for the town

	Evacuation points are where residents will evacuate too.

	Locations require a coordinate (easting, northing).

	The town is divided into "regions".
	If no regions are defined, the software assumes the whole area is one region.

	Routes are defined by a sequence of control points.
	If no routes are defined, a route with a single waypoint (the relief centre) is created for each region.
